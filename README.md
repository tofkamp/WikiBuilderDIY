Digital build with wikihouse parts

A very simple 3D builder program with Wikihouse WHALM pieces.

Download and extract the zip file.  Start the fps3.exe program.
Movement with the keys WASD and QE.
Use INSERT and DELETE to choose piece to build with.
With the numpad you can rotate the shape (46 82 and 79).

With , and . you can select the connector, aim with the mouse, and fire (left) to place it. Use right mouse for place and hold.
Press ESC to exit.

In de current directory there will be a file called world.json with the current build info. Also a world.obj file with the 3d shape.

In de subdirectory there is a program to create your own shapes and library.

Have fun,
