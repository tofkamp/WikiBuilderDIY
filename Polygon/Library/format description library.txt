The library is a dictionary of every name, containing the shape.

Every shape has the following information:
connectors2 = list of connectors2
#edges = not used (yet)
faces = list of triple of quad vertices-point-nrs with a face of the shape. Can be used to show the shape in 3D or export it to obj file
name = the name of the shape
thickness = 18 The thickness of the plate where shapes can be cut out to make 3d objects (wikihouse) in mm
vertices = list of xyz coordinates for every point, start counting from 1 (see faces)
centroid = x,y,z center of object
volume = the volume in mm3 (cubic mm)

a connectors2 (like a box) object has:
centroid =  x,y,z center of object
#edges = not used (yet)
#faces = list of triple of quad vertices-point-nrs with a face of the shape. Can be used to show the shape in 3D or export it to obj file
#vertices = list of xyz coordinates for every point, start counting from 1 (see faces)
type = size in text with "x" between, sorted from smaal to large, eg "18x18x60"
widthX the widht in x direction of the whole cube
heightY the height in Y direction of the whole cube
depthZ in Z direction, usual is this 18mm
rotateZ rotation around Z axis in degrees, (depends of which way the last line was drawn)
